## Satellite Information Formatting

When adding new satellites from the satinfo.txt use the following formatting:

`Name;NoradID;Mode;Uplink;Downlink;AltName`


Example:

`ISS;25544;FM;145.990;437.800;ZARYA`


### Things to note

Make sure there are no empty newlines at the bottom of the file. 

If the satellite doesn't have an alternate name, just put "None"
